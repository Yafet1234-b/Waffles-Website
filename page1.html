<p>The history of the waffle is a global journey from ancient, simple wafers to the diverse, beloved breakfast food we enjoy today.</p>

<h2>Ancient Origins</h2>

<p>The waffle's lineage begins in ancient Greece, with flat cakes called obleios cooked between two hot metal plates. These early versions were simple and often savory. This method endured, evolving into oublies in medieval Europe, primarily made in monasteries for communion.</p>
<h2>The European Evolution</h2>
<p>By the 13th century, irons were forged with a honeycomb pattern, leading to the name "waffle" (from the Dutch wafel or French gaufre). The first known recipe appeared in a 14th-century manuscript.
The 16th century brought a major change: the addition of leavening agents like brewer's yeast. This innovation created the thicker waffles prevalent in Belgium, leading to distinct regional varieties like the light Brussels waffle and the dense, sweet Liège waffle.</p>
<h2>Across the Atlantic</h2>
<p> Waffles arrived in North America with Dutch settlers. Thomas Jefferson helped popularize them among the American gentry after bringing an iron back from France. The modern English spelling was established in 1725.
A key American innovation occurred in 1869 when Cornelius Swarthout was granted the first U.S. patent for a waffle iron, an event celebrated annually as National Waffle Day.</p>
<h2>Modern Innovations</h2>
<p>The 20th century made waffles a convenient staple:</p>
<p>1918: General Electric introduced the first electric waffle iron for home use.</p>
<p>1950s: The Dorsa brothers created a process for mass-producing frozen waffles, which became the popular Eggo brand.</p>
<p>1964: Belgian waffles, served with fruit and whipped cream, became a national sensation at the New York World's Fair.</p>
<p>From ancient Greek griddles to modern frozen convenience, the waffle has truly stood the test of time.</p>
