    <h1> Instructions </h1>
      <p>Preheat the waffle iron.
      <p>Turn on your waffle iron and let it heat up completely according to the manufacturer's instructions. Most models have an indicator light that signals when they are ready.</p>
      <p> Mix dry ingredients. </p>
      <p> In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. </p>
      <p>Mix wet ingredients. </p>
      <p>In a separate medium bowl, whisk the eggs, then add the milk, oil or melted butter, and vanilla extract (if using). Whisk until well combined.</p>
      <p>Combine wet and dry. </p>
      <p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir just until combined; a few lumps are okay. </p>
      <p>Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this can result in tough, chewy waffles.</p>
      <p>Cook the waffles. Lightly grease the preheated waffle iron with cooking spray or a little extra oil. Pour the appropriate amount of batter (check your waffle iron's manual for the exact amount, usually 1/2 to 3/4 cup) onto the hot iron and close the lid.</p>
      <p>Cook until golden. Cook the waffles until they are golden brown and crisp, typically for 3 to 5 minutes. A common indicator that a waffle is done is when the iron stops steaming.</p>
      <p>Serve. Gently remove the cooked waffles using a fork or tongs and place them on a wire rack to prevent them from getting soggy. Serve immediately with butter, maple syrup, or your favorite toppings. </p>
      <p> It is time to dig in!!!</p>
